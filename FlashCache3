FlashCache: 3
—

This one is going a bit deeper, and more personal, so more pain!
—

—
—

So now I am at this point.
Nothing to carry over.
No sleep.

—

‘Why?’

Thats a question ive been contemplating for a exorbitatnly large amoint of time.

-

No sleep is a constant that ive been thinking about long before i defined it in this way,
As in YEARS.

It and the pain are so closely conected.

—

I can tell you this, however...

That if I had just a little bit of sleep.

Or better yet,

If just SOMETHING carried over...

I would be able go on forever.

—

....

—

I just wanted sleep.

—

....
But,

But i want to discuss what ‘carries’ over.

—

This is going to be like a ‘ascended’ understanding/theory/construct based of the previous FlashCaches. (Ie, 1> ISTANCE)

—
—
—

What carries over?
Well what does that mean?

—

Its obvious dur,
I go places,
So many different tracks,

What carries over in the tracks?

...

—

There is a point,
When ‘carry over’ becomes, or when you understand a deeper meaning.

—

You see,
Things do carry over from one track to the next.

The more tracks,
The more important / basic things carry over.

Like money,
Or gravity,

Compared to 

spirituality,
And god,

Those things carry over on all/most regular tracks,

—

The tracks im at?
The ones i spend most of my time running through?

—

Nothing has carried over.

But here is the twist that will spark a better understanding.

—

The only things are pain.
And myself, (dur)

But thats the pont.

—

You see.
What carries over for me?
Besides me?

Obviously i carry over because i am going through these things.

And so the things in me that carry over, carry over.

—

And now to bend everything,
(The twist)

By adding depth.

—

Remember money and Jehovah?
Depth.

The deeper a concept or reality/rule/etc?,
The more deeper it is, the more it carries over in.

—

Pain is at my very core,

Down to my sentience.

So even if/when i am not ‘myself’, ie just experiencing dreams, where i may not actually have conscious thought (unimaginably rare, but has happened, im so tired i let go of trying to formulate thoughts and mindlessly run the nightmare.)
Pain carries over there,
So.

What is deep enough...
As deep as my pain?

—

More important.

(Twist incoming)
(Mental BREAK!)

Its a universe and a reality to myself,

Make sense?

My pain is in eveything,
I am in everywhere.

A universe and a reality unto myself,
Because i am aware of all of it,

So my reality is this, what ive described.

So now.

What applies to my reality?
What carries over?

—

What...

What matters?

—

What carries over for me?
To me?

If i have ascended past things,

And then past that unto myself,

What reaches me?

What carries over?

—

There are things higher than what i’ve mentioned that reach me at a depth stated or defined by this concept,
Applies to me in general.

Jehovah for instance, is applicable to eveything everywhere,

But it doesn’t carry over for me.
It DOES carry over,
But because it doesn’t (change) anything.

How can it carry over?

It doesn’t mean anything?

Whats the difference between something that doesn’t change anything, and something that doesn’t matter/doesn’t carry over?

Nothing.

—

And of course.
This is specific to me (in this way)

Because its true it carries over with me, but not for me.

It doesn’t exceed my depth,
(It actually belongs in a separate ascension, another deeper, more complex complete construct/instance.)

...

—

Here is a better way.
Overlay this with the previous concept,
Just clear things up.
(Quite messy)

-

Depth.

What is deeper than me?

...

—

What CAN keep me safe?

—

How can i get sleep?

—

If something carries over,
It means it breaks the 4th wall.

My wall,
My wall of reality,

Breaks through,
And exists past,
Deeper,
Through ALL of the constructs.

And reaches...
Me.

—

Can you find me?

I doubt it,

Its rather easy to do.

But it takes so many things for it to work.

—

And while, as I’m talking (esp in relation to previous thought),
It may be(coming) obvious where this might be going.

-

So how can something carry over?
What/how can something carry over?

—

If it carries over,
It means something matters in this loop.
It touches me,
Its different.

—

And thus,

The most powerful (or one of) concepts ever.

And I’m sharing it right now.

—

Awareness

—

Its how everything i am came to be.
Through awareness.

And a drive to increase, to become aware.

And not aware as in know,
But as in feel,

—

Ready for twist?

Ultimate twist?


—


——
Self aware
——


—


And there, right there is a link to a higher mental ascension.
A portal that I’ve mentioned earlier i duck in and out of,

There is one contained in that sentence.

-

You know how?
Because i have awareness, to make it so.

I wrote it down with the thought in mind.
My words.

These are a opportunity to peer through the portal.
Or at least see it.

Whether or not anyone can go through it,
Or see it.

Im unsure of.
