I need sleep.
It’s what i need.
And im tired.
—
I mentioned before,
That not much carries over.
And i dont think there is a single thing that carries over for me.
—
But i can tell you what it is that can,
And how much it would help....
....
Bah.
—
But im tired...
....
—
You know how good it would be.
To finish a track,
And go to your little homebase.
Park,
And then shut off?
Sleep?
Actually ‘let go’
—
I havnt done that in at LEAST 4 years.
And in retrospect, maybe a lot longer,
It just is worse NOW because of pain.
I am WAY faster,
More tacks!
All of them harder!
More obstackes,
Shorter time limit,
And crashing is a lot worse.
Setbacks are more.
And more tired.
And then everything ELSE,
As in those are all sidenotes to the underlying universe constants, systems, and things that continually hurt me.
A whole other set of mental tracks,
A whole other job,
Keeping myself mentally stable,
Awake,
Alert,
And dealing with the emotional,
Psychological turmoil,
Pain,
Confusion,
Tears,
Death,
Pain (did i mention that...)
And pain! (Third time right?)
Staying positive.
Not cracking jnder pressure,
Somehow staying liek a Christain.
Trying to be caring,
Humble,
Forgiving,
Calm.
And progressing!
Progressing in these spiritual traits,
In habits,
In studying,
ON TOP! (LITERALLY!)
OF EVERYTHING!
somehow,
As a priority.
I mean, not like i...
I jave to be doing those things, intertwined with eveything else.
Because in able to dohose things, i jave to keep myself on track,
Mentally,
And on the track im talking about,
And dealing wih this,
Its all connected,
Without this.
...
This is good,
I can do it wihout this.
Its not distracting, or taking away from my apirituality,
And it has some benefits.
-x
These notes that are mine (that aren’t necessarily about me),
Are also my most valiable and precious belongings.
....
-
In fact..
These may be the only things that are ‘mine’.
No, they aren’t Jehovahs, not like im keeping it away from him.
But it does belong to me.
Like...
I dont know its so messy when dealing with this subject about what is and is not Jehovahs,
We could say its his but he lets me have it,
But thats bot, necessarily correct either.
So just forget it,
Im too tired to explain it correctly, (one of many)
But im sure there are better ways.
(
One is this: *and this is me coming back after finishing this*, these notes are mine, not Jehovah’s. I wrote them, i am the author. But i obviously allow his purpose to override kine. Thus the point. We are ourselves... not Jehovah. And Jehovah doesn’t ‘have us’, we belong to Jehovah because we choose to, we belong/are ourselves. This is obviously extremely delicate and sensitive, BUT, i think it does cut it close enough to make sense free of main errors. We ARE ourselves, our thoughts belong to us not to Jehovah, but we let his purpose (thoughts) to mold us. It won’t work if all already belongs to him directly. (Directly is a good patch/key.)
)
—
Anyways, just scratch it all out.
Sorry,
I will probably apologize to Jehovah later....
—
Actually.
I dont think i ahve to.
I WILL,
Im definetly willing.
But take this,
A man and a wife,
(Which was what i was going to use, but figured out how to do it.)
Belong to each other.
They are one flesh.
Jehovah is not necessarily (one flesh) with them.
Instead,
They are together as one,
Doing Jehovah’s will.
Bounded by Jehovah.
Together, as one belonging to ONLY each other,
They belong to Jehovah.
Threefold cord right?
That makes sense since Jehovah joined Adam with Eve.
Not himself.
But each other.
Through him.
His purpsoe.
And so his purpose, his commandments,
Is like that thread,
That intertwines them together.
-
Thats how i see it.
At least...
If its wrong, then it will change, as Jehovah continues to mold me.
Maybe I’m completely wrong.
Its not throwing any errors up however, and i dont feel like Jehovah is telling me no or something.
Because logically that WAS AND IS his purpose for us.
....
Bah.
Too much pain, clouds judgment, so I’m dont with that.

—
I just need some sleep.
And i was mentioning the things.
That carry over.
...
My notes are inside me.
They stem from me,
So the carry over indirectly.
Although in truth,
No not really.
They cause no change,
Although technically that is different...
Bah,
Pain.

I just need some sleep.

Like when you are done with tracks in the game,
You teleport to another track,
And then/or home.
Anlong base,
Tucked away in a safe location.
Still connected anywyas.
You drive up.
Park.
And sleep.
-
Then wake up,
Ready to hit more roads.
Or dreading different roads.
Either way,
You are at a place that is measurably ‘safe’.
Just like real life sleep,
Sometimes you may get bad sleep,
Or something may keep you up.
But at least you aren’t on the track.
And many times you may not by yourself.
And for you, and many people,
Either you have some things that carry over (for you),
And you don’t have the pain,
(Which by itself are enough to be a difference.)
Many of the tracks are maybe easier,(not really..)
(But if so its because mine are harder the ones I/we share because of extra things running through my mind that overlay a regular track making it harder)
And you don’t go to nearly as many tracks as i go to.
—
You see.
Thats a large part of it,
I don’t stop.
When I ‘sleep’,
I dont GO somewhere safe,
When i ‘teleport’,
I go to other tracks,
Most of which are beyond beyond.
Bad dreams are perhaps these kind of tracks you and other may go through that are similar in concpet.
—
But mine are different because of the (insert link to [CORE])
They are so much...
My dreams are yet another thing that i run throuh besides,
The overlay of pain and the many other tracks inlive hrough,
Those of which overlay my dreams, but unlike real life where they make the regular track harder and make it more painful to reset and whatever,
It direclty interfaces with the track.
The track isnt the same.
Its not really ‘overlay’.
Its something entirely different.
Dreams dont have meaning,
Mine do.
Simply because i understand.
(And while I’m aware that this and the last previous statement or definitely incorrect, there is a point here.)
They are a personal pain,
On that interfaces with the much grander and complete dimensional ripping thing that no one goes through.
Those tracks make real life tracks seem like literally nothing.
And the thing is,
These tracks i run WHILE (again overlaid) with real life tracks,
And at times,
I go to those tracks,
Zipping in and out of them.
(In regular tracks, min-portals put me on that track)
**this is a tad messy eh? But point is still there**
And no ine has ever seen them.
Or been down them.
And evrything collides into one long neverendig tracks,
Each glimpse,
Each moment of my conscious an unconsious snentient life besting..
A tick on the clock.
A second.
Of my clock,
On that never stops,
Just like me.
No peace,
No nothing.
—
Just running.
Ducking.
Dodging.
Jumling.
Spinning.
When i am runnig hot,
And running good,
Pain is down,
My engine is humming,
And i am running clean.
Flying so fast,,,
Whipping around ibstalces,
Making rapid progress,
Gliding hrough the track,
Jump, spin, land..
Perfectly.
Like butter,
Perfect.
It’s pretty.
It’s nice,
And im not the only one,
I just do the same thing as everyone else but on a completley different scale.
-
Heres how that works.
Remember the overlay?
They arent shortcuts,
Jsut extra track.
Like a tesseract,
But backwars,
Go through protal, do another track,
Jump back in at same point,
(Sometimes at same time)
Thats a mind break,
Its at same time.
Which can be quantified and efined by this.
Time.
Time for both,
Badically,
I run so fast,
But because of longer track,
The time for the regular track isn’t necdesarily faster.
And thus,
I have to ‘catch up’.
Why i go about 2x-more (this isnt humble but the idea is there, and its kinda important.)
(We can balance this by my ability to go WAY faster on those tracks perhaps, but slower or regular on these tracks, thus i am still logically behind but same speed. But this is just a cheat/patch, dont use it, it doesnt make sense)
Because they are both merged, and the same,
Mind break.
I have to do ‘both’..
Bah.
Mind break is mind break.
Point should be there though.
I think it is.
*shrug
-
And its interesting,
I spend so much time doing and progressing through these ‘other’ tracks,
I am behind on this track,
And on other tracks,
Spiritual,
Physical health,
Etc...
So i have to handle this track, becuase this track helps me mentally.
(This specifc one, relating to the ‘other’ tracks that no one else has gone thouh..[? I think?])
So doing this,
Helps me do others.
And of course,
Im technically doing them all at same time.
But it works because i have to focus,
Or consciously make choices/thoughts to actually progress and then of course applying them.
Blating throuh so many tracks,
Switch to ‘doig oush-ups’
And then blast into ‘spiritual routine’
Just flying past me.
Figuring each track,
Trying to look ahead if i can.
Sometimes i can,
Sometimes i cant.
Im just running and running.
I can (of course now logically) make a teleport or jump-gate (different than the mini jumps/teleports, like game they are different)
Which now makes sense how i can look ahead.
Run so fast, be so good you can actually look ahead.
And then teleport, then teleport back and try and continue where you left off.
(BIG NOTE: this is actually a different perspective than the previous ones before this. I think this is better, but they ARE separate.)
—
Anyways,
No sleep.
Just teleporting, then portaling(jumping)
Running, and running.
No stop.
No break.
Nothing.
Just endless, think, react, move.
Never enough,
Never fast enough,
Never correct enough.
Running through landmines of peoples emotions,
Which i then (die) and then reset.
Perhaps even going on another track (same actual track technically)
*(have main track life, and sub-jumps/teleports to thinking, like in thoughts.)*
Fixing it,
Going back.
And burning through.
Not stopping,
Not slowing down (unless i techncially have to)
But it all blazing past me.
A blur of lights,
Fire,
Obstacles,
Walls,
Air.
Track.
As the clock on my dash ticks.
...
-
Never jumping to a place i can actually be ok at,
Never stopping.
You don’t stop.
Its all a blur,
Until all i feel is pain.
And a faint blurry pain in my eyes....

**wow, this was a lot. This may be my best one yet that I have written.**
*this is surprisingly succinct**
**and makes me a little happy to see how the 1> ISTANCE init is working**
