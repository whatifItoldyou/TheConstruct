------
Everything you read in here is based on a concept or idea to give you context of what i've been through.
1. This is a extremely (and disconnected, as I will mention earlier) limited and purposed construct.
2. the POINT is a way of .... it will make sense. but understand this isnt ABOUT the past. That is something definetly seperate/
, on many many levels.
3. remember not only is all of this a SINGLE concept, but everything mentioned in here is 1%. (literally, I suppose)

IMPORTANT:
by 1%, I cover a lot.
and by a lot, I mean a lot.

1. 1%
Concept: E=mc^2 is a simple equation, and in these notes, everything is 'simplified' in that way.
Providing only relevant context to make a point, much of things being implied.

So when I say 1%, its possible/and-quite-frankly-is that everything ELSE is definitely connected to the things you read here./
(that statement before this/above^^ IS incorrect, which (hopefully) will become appearent after i discuss/ or you go through/
these notes.)

2. emotions
... I (try to) think of myself as a very logical person.... [[BREAK]]
--[[BREAK]]
Concept: (this is a example of layering)
I can be logical THROUGH emotions, so anger and rage can be used to increase mental clock speed, thereby making me more logical/
because I am following natural train of thought faster, and also because you can connect more and more thoughts with 'power'/,
, 'energy', 'focus', 'concentration', 'determination'. (what music does for me)
HOWEVER!!!
Because it is being done this way (or in ways/emtotions[and this should be obvious/implied]) the emotion/way /
(because I dont work, none of us work in simple Rage/Anger or Sadness, and esp with me there is a great deal of /
mental CACHE and contect (cached based) that affects that concept of using it to 'throttle')
It can get tainted or done in a flavor. Done in a 'mood' perhaps. Logic path can be affected by the things mentioned above. 
... ^^(should be obvious by now what those are, but just in case, the entire CACHE/context (of self) and emotions. /
the conglomerate whole of those(<</^) things)
--[[BREAK]]

so with that context and content(?), you know understand that this is writtien in a, 'instance' of me. 
(and throw the word away ['instance], because it means something different upcoming. so its used as this ONLY, /
not defined as 'me', (implied when I say instance, I am referring to me when im writitng the things.) NOT that.

3. ..... so much... ahh give me a sec

4. Her
...
history, and past.
but that exists on a different level than any of this (the FlashCaches), which I make reference too. (later)

BUT!
something happened,
I said something,
mental break,
and now...
this is like a small drop of water,
at the END of a LONG/LARGE amounts of things happeneing.
its like a small detail of a end of a 'neverending' movie.
[through that^^ away, it sucks and it isnt completely correct, and I dont like it. but the POINT should have come acroos..]

5.
read it from 1-5
i have others,
and I may make more depending on any questions you have.

6. idk, i think thats it.
head hurts, having to retrace all these documents mentally to reference to them here.
its a lot.
and I had to do all that JUST now. small headache, but got some Camellia in background.. and this itself helps /
(what ur about to read) a good bit.

alright.
go read.
call me when you are ready. (*shrug)
