------
Everything you read in here is based on a concept or idea to give you context of what i've been through.
1. This is a extremely (and disconnected, as I will mention earlier) limited and purposed construct.
2. the POINT is a way of .... it will make sense. but understand this isnt ABOUT the past. That is something definetly seperate/
, on many many levels.
3. remember not only is all of this a SINGLE concept, but everything mentioned in here is 1%. (literally, I suppose)

IMPORTANT:
by 1%, I cover a lot.
and by a lot, I mean a lot.

1. 1%
Concept: E=mc^2 is a simple equation, and in these notes, everything is 'simplified' in that way.
Providing only relevant context to make a point, much of things being implied.

So when I say 1%, its possible/and-quite-frankly-is that everything ELSE is definitely connected to the things you read here./
(that statement before this/above^^ IS incorrect, which (hopefully) will become appearent after i discuss/ or you go through/
these notes.)

2. emotions
... I (try to) think of myself as a very logical person.... [[BREAK]]
--[[BREAK]]
Concept: (this is a example of layering)
I can be logical THROUGH emotions, so anger and rage can be used to increase mental clock speed, thereby making me more logical/
because I am following natural train of thought faster, and also because you can connect more and more thoughts with 'power'/,
, 'energy', 'focus', 'concentration', 'determination'. (what music does for me)
HOWEVER!!!
Because it is being done this way (or in ways/emtotions[and this should be obvious/implied]) the emotion/way /
(because I dont work, none of us work in simple Rage/Anger or Sadness, and esp with me there is a great deal of /
mental CACHE and contect (cached based) that affects that concept of using it to 'throttle')
It can get tainted or done in a flavor. Done in a 'mood' perhaps. Logic path can be affected by the things mentioned above. 
... ^^(should be obvious by now what those are, but just in case, the entire CACHE/context (of self) and emotions. /
the conglomerate whole of those(<</^) things)
--[[BREAK]]

so with that context and content(?), you know understand that this is writtien in a, 'instance' of me. 
(and throw the word away ['instance], because it means something different upcoming. so its used as this ONLY, /
not defined as 'me', (implied when I say instance, I am referring to me when im writitng the things.) NOT that.

3. CONTEXT
Distance.
Search up the game, try to get a feel for its story.
if not? here is short version.

Virus attacks The Array, a space station, that houses a large network of computers/information
You are a antivurs represented as a vehicle.
you are also completely alone, in the entire array.

You have to go through courses dodging obstacles and navigating the broken/abandoned parts of the Array. (screw capitals)
That the virus has affected/destroyed/etc...

If you get off track so that you cant recover (because most of the track is open air/over death)
you hit T to reset. Your car makes backups of itself every 'checkpoint' (like a checkpoint, dur)
you reset at checkpoint keep going.

You chase after the virus before it reaches Earth.

You then find it, and the rest is blah blah blah, you basically disable and kill/beat the virus by smashing core peices of it/
when it swallows you (it opens itself and sucks you in on a track it made to kill you, which you have to beat by finishing//
going the track (or Distance, as in going the whole Distance) to break panes that represent its core.

and then it dissipates/explodes/breaks
and then you (because you are in teleporter as its happening)
get transported to earch, dissasembled game ends.

you've seen the game how the car moves, if not watch my videos. or look it up.
also teleporters for each levels, and short portal for moving around the level/track/'instane'(more on that<<<< l8r)

and that should be it. everything else you should be apply to figure out / implied.


4. Her
...
history, and past.
but that exists on a different level than any of this (the FlashCaches), which I make reference too. (later)

BUT!
something happened,
I said something,
mental break,
and now...
this is like a small drop of water,
at the END of a LONG/LARGE amounts of things happeneing.
its like a small detail of a end of a 'neverending' movie.
[through that^^ away, it sucks and it isnt completely correct, and I dont like it. but the POINT should have come acroos..]

5.
read it from 1-5
i have others,
and I may make more depending on any questions you have.
and re-read it if it doesnt make sense, these notes complement each other, so if you JUST cannot figure it out, try the best /
and keep moving. the (if you want to) go back and see if it makes sense.

6. idk, i think thats it.
head hurts, having to retrace all these documents mentally to reference to them here.
its a lot.
and I had to do all that JUST now. small headache, but got some Camellia in background.. and this itself helps /
(what ur about to read) a good bit.

alright.
go read.
call me when you are ready. (*shrug)
