Context: the game Distance
Etc:
I am too tired to bridge this hypothetical to actual real life, so this knowledge must be implied. /
Because i am too tired, to bridge it and relate it directly over. /
Im NOT saying ‘use your imagination’ but understand the construct HERE, /
then relate it to real life. Dont try and interpret it, understand the whole thing correctly, /
then you can tie that into real life. This first, because its the point thats important, /
and less of how each ‘piece’ matches up.

I am a vehicle.
Now, most vehicles.
Most people,
Get sleep.
They finish the tracks for the day.
Go someplace rather auiet,
And go to sleep.
Everybody does.
—
Me?
I don’t.
I just go through teleporter after teleporter.
Different realms.
-
Perhaps when i go to sleep.
And my body has a reat,
My mind teleports to another vehicle form.
And just continues in ankther track.
Wakes up,
In the middle of the track.
-x
And thats my entire life,
Waking up in the middle of a track,
Going so fast,
So tited,
The road blurry,
Straking past me,
Noise all around me,
My vision bourry,
So tired.
And yet,
I can’t stop.
-
If I do?
Then i crash.
I fall off the track (because if you not movig, momentum won’t keep you on course. Default is death/ or perhaps sin even.)
I must push.
Because if I dont,
Then i fall behind.
And then the track gets harder and harder.
-x
Ph yeah.
Did i mention the track moves as I’m down it?
As im on it?
Thigs change,
And the track fools you.
-
Things look a certain way,
But then because of inexperience,
And because i just cant,
Know,
Everything all at once!
I crash.
BAM!
Someone gets offended,
I have to painfully ‘reset’,
Apologize for the millionth time.
Redo a part of the track,
This tme its probably harder,
And keep moving.
—
Im racing a clock.
The clock of life.
I keep it on,
To keep me grounded to keep going.
Define speed,
So i can go fast.
—
And i keep going.
...
But not just by myself
—
No,
I have this pain.
That afflicts me myself,
-
See you think its like the game.
Which is insane hard enough,
Pefectly seeing in third person view,
The track that doesnt move.
-
Real life?
You can’ see nearly as kuch.
And everything is more blurry,
And feels so much faster.
So much harder,
To react.
-
But more than that.
I jave an entire conpeltely different level of dimensions of problems.
IN MY HEAD!
That clog my vision
—
I have this pain.
That when it strikes.
My mind glitches out of my defined world.
Out of the ‘ ehicle’,
Out of the ‘track’
Out of the entire defiend instance universe of hypohetical illustration.
And it feels,
Everything.
The pain.
Of thigs i cant explain.
Strike and sllinter,
Crackle through me.
—
It happens fast sometimes.
Like a blink when its over,
But during?
It consumes everything.
And its forever,
Until its not.
—
It hurts.
Sometimes,
When im alone in a dark track of mind,
Perhaps a bit basic,
And i am just moving.
The pain worries me.
Instead of me going direclty to it.
-
I go tired,
And i (sort of) hallucinate,
Small flickers of it appear in my world.
Strike,
With my eyes open.
Her face,
The universe,
Pain,
Jehovah,
What’s riht,
What’s wrong,
Darkness.
Flash.
Like lightning in a black sky.
—
And it slowly creeps in my vision.
It dements and distorts what i see.
When I’m alone,
Its always there.
—
And thats why i used to like having lights on.
Why i used to prefer when other people were awake.
-
But i learned that didn’t matter.
They weren’t with me on this track,
They didn’t carry over,
And did nothing for me,
Or my pain.
—
I can’t run from it,
I can’t escape from it.
-
And im always moving,
Try so hard ot to give up,
To reset,
To throttle the afterxbruner,
To keep pushing.
—
All without sleep.
—
Going through tracks,
And pain.
Over and over again.
—
Again.
The same,
A loop.
What carries over?
So whats the difference?
—
Whats a loop?
When nothing changes.
—
And thats my life.
...
-
The only things that change are me.
But not my pain.
And not me giving up.
—
Im so tired,
And can you imagine,
Having so much context now,
How it feels to do and go through all of this alone?
Utterly alone.
Dealing with universes and complete constructs of complicated things,
With no help,
All alone,
Fighting the spiritual side of thing also!?
Intertwined?
And all of this.
With no sleep,
—
Even Jehovah isn’t there with me.
How can he?
Things are not simple.
He constructed the basics of this ‘track’.
Its not like he’s not there.
But i cant hug Jehovah can I?
The whole thing is different,
Its not the same.
Apples to oranges.
And everything I do,
Is for Jehovah.
—
And yes,
Sometimes he helps me.
And by reading the Bible,
Meditating in spiritual counsel,
The tracks get a little easier.
He helps me out when obstacles stop me from moving.
-
But he can’t do much more than that for me without,
Breaking rules?
I dont know.
But i know it hasn’t stopped.
—
Im tired.
With nothing.
Nothing.
No one.
And no reason.
Not even “live forever on a paradise earth” offers me much comfort.
That in itself doesn’t stop this.
This loop.
This pain.
—
All i have.
I use,
(Besides some very meaningless small things)
(Which is everything)
To help me go on?
Music is one.
Music.
Jehovah, and his will,
And doing what is right,
All have a small satisfaction.
—
Don’t misunderstand me.
Jehovah and his will are the most important things in my life,
Everything i do, or try ti do is to please Jehovah and fulfill his purpose.
So its not ‘reasons’ why,
Or purposes.
I dont have a reason to DO any of these things...
Not one for myself,
And not one that helps me.
I don’t really have a real reason to serve Jehovah asside from one thjg.
I choose to,
Because it’s the right thing.
I
And i want to serve him, and i want to do the right thing.
And while this explanation is correct,
Its still a very basic explanation.
A better one is basically i have no choice,
Things are tired with the way i am and who i am.
Ut thats a story for a different time.
(Not story, but you should get what i mean.)
