why exactly is everything painful?

and why?

--

like why this?
why am i typing this, not like why this.

but why in general?

--
I dont understand, almost as much as you don't (currently, i guess, or thats what it feels like)

-

why?
why am/have I gone through this,
why in this timeline.
why?

i dont understsand. Im not special... really..
I dont get what happened,
i mean, I get what happened.
I do.

and it has made logical sense to me (after unimaginable stress, mental clocking, time, and pain. a lot of pain)

--

i just dont get WHY it happened.

--
something like this can't be random right?
cant be THIS random right?

--

im not stupid,
i get what this looks like,
and why does it look like this?
i get that it has too, and that their is only so much I can say/write/type/explain....
but why?

why do I have to do this in the first place? (like this)

--

why did I send you these?

...
really why?

--

am I just so weak I couldnt bear pain without giving it out/away?

im not calling out to....

--

never mind, these notes arent abaout any of ^^^^^^^ direcetly.

its about coping with all ^^^^^, thus why I sent you those(these)

--

still.

I marvel at my pain.

I just,
kinda cant beleive it.

its affeects on my entire life,
my consciousness,
my interpreatation or living,

its kinda amazing.

how it all came from someting simple (or simple things, refer to E=mc2)

*coughs

ahh.

sorry, was in pain, is alll.
its all written from pain, and it hurts more because im not overclocking.
if I was overclocking id be moving and focused, 
instead of asking these questions,

the very same ones I've been asking myself for the past 2 years...
and I may very well be asking myself for the next....

2...

million?

*coughs

*puts dubstep on

ok, thats a little better.
not by a lot,
but its better than whatever was going on before.

--

this note IS useful.

it explains,
and shows,

WHY i needed to make a Construct

--

becuase again,
focusing on something,
gets me moving, progressing,

flying through the portals, the tracks,

keeps me moving.

moving, depsite pain, and then mentally past it,

--although
alghough i have a equation,
that i can use to formalte a architecture in this construct,
so that I can safely 'store' my pain.
that is restrict it from popping up,
hadnling it,
and giving it SOME define/rules, so that I can deal with it to some degree.
-
its so complicated.
because of its depth, and mild unpredictabiity.
it also is one of the only things that carries over,
which is a problem, means I have to deal with it on its level,
or use some mental reality bending/weaving,
overcomplexification,
to figure out a way to .... do this.
(im too tired to mentally figure it out right now,)
(because it would mean actually DOING what I said i have plans to do)

0-
**coughs. (=pain surge/stab)

anyways.
It involves the SS (s0l1d-st^te) drive.
putting it away, and all its major references.

it means defieing parts of my mind,
things that /patterns that cause my pain,
which I disscussed in the whattodonow note.
which hopefully we'll have a chance to do later.

**cough...... (-------------------------------------------------------------------)

ah

[ok, this isnt working....]

and yeah, its always like this,
write now (pun intended)
im writing from my active cache, or interpreting from my active cache or mind basically.
and since this is deeper sstuff, it is most of the..
its a lot of raw data, like a complete active dump of a computer.
but interepreted thankfully.

point is, i have to writie about the...
because im already writitng,.
its automatic. sort of...

anyways, i dont HAVE to.
but again, everything is connected

perhaps intution on your part can identify patterns,
like how pain can lead me to some llgical change/conclusion,
and itss affect on my thinking.
i guess....

(not really, at least nnot more than I do/can/have)

--

whoo, this is better
(GALAXYBURST - Camellia)

--

its amazing...
how 1 song,
simple pictures,,

can put my entire life inside out (mentally)
can hurt me so much.

its amazing.

im like beside myself,
anyways, those things we are putting away.

anwyays...

--

just gotta keep moving.

--

i do have a question.

does it end?

--

and dont give me the 'paradise' talk.
ive had most of that (mentally) covered by the first 6 months.

i dont think it does.

--

at some moments,
i want to throw my hands up.

i hit a wall,
and resetting hurts so much, and its hard
its hard for everyone...

but imagine its the same obstacle as earelier,
some one
over and over,
o
on top of being extremely tired...

and then yoyu just move and move,
going through all kinds of tracks,
all of them,

just moving through them
(not neccesarily overcllcking, so not like BLASTING, and not glitching either. and more about that... perhaps)

and nothing chcangs.

it means nothing.

all of it changes nothing (for me dur)

nothing carries over, understand now?

it is so hard to stay motiviated,
going through the tracks over and over again,
so painful.

--

other times?
i feel like I can do this all day.
I feel like I cant go fast enough,
and there is so much (happily) to do.

--breakline
its funny, this is my first note actually talking about, well,
the actual thing. thankfully the entire idea is different from a straight construct, but this is the broader version,
which is obvous because this whole time I really havent said anything special. at all.... (in my retrospect)
--breakline

but I feel like I can do it forever...
I sometimes enjoy moving,
flipping, dodging,
blasting...

like most people, sure,
but for me,
just the tunnel vision,

just the... rush?

of life, and figuring out stuff.
which is saying I like thinking.
i do,

but most of it hurts me,
problem is,

what else is there?
i have,
need to keep moving.

if I dont...


well.....

thats a entirely different subject for a time not near to this one.

--

this is for context
and its a very complied version of the real thing,
bits and peices of the real subject, put together in a thought line to give you context.
this isnt even a level, nor potrayed as such.

all these things come from different levels,
and different areas of the major subject (of which you/most/....... know about. ah just (reader use discernment))

referenced to, and presented as one (level) article/line.
--


and thats that.

ive got a headache..
and its not going away.

i guess...
